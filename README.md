# TitanicSurvivability
Submission to the Titanic competition on Kaggle.

I am using this as an experiment to relearn and understand SHAP values.
Achieves 0.72 Test score.

The SHAP results were much as one would expect. Women and children were saved first. Passengers on a class 3 tickets were less likely to be saved, and class 1 ticket holders were more likely to be saved. Port of boarding had little impact.

## Further Work

This model is not optimized at all, as the project is just a quick experiment. I am not currently working on improving this.
